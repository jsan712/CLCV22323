## Response Paper 4 -- Based on your readings, please provide a short (max. 200 words) response on what GIS is and how it informs the archaeological research.

GIS stands for Geographic Information System and it is a computer system that analyzes and displays geographically referenced information. It informs archaeological research by allowing researchers to have site specific information without having to go to the site. GIS can also allow researchers to model ancient trade networks, overlay different shapes that they have created to recreate the layout of ancient sites, and record new findings in extensive detail. A variety of different built in layers can also provide a new lens to look at the ancient world and give new analysis to current understandings of that site/region. In order to achieve this, GIS softwares needs spatial coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevation) to use as a reference point for other data.
