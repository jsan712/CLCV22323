## Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (TLL)
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: The Thesaurus linguae Latinae has existed since 1893, with the actual work of compiling the articles begining in 1899. Since it has existed longer than the computer, this joint project between 38 universities across the globe will be around for a long time. There are also ways to download the information from the site, blogs, a large team, a podcast, and an archive, suggesting that the site and the project are well maintained, evolving, and has a large enough interest to be around in some capacity for a lifetime. 

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: The site does not charge a license fee, you can download volumes from the site, there is contact information listed, a list of all contributors and to where they contributed, and there is a lot of transparency about the organization behind the project. However, the lack of explicit dating of updates, the lack of revision announcements, and the inability for individuals to contribute knocks the grade down.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: This is a thesaurus, so there will not be any visualizations or maps; however, the features the sites does have, it does well. There are dedicated sections for how to use each aspect of the Thesaurus, how to access and use the Digital Archive, and the downloadable content. The search function is also intuitive and expansive.

* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: The Thesaurus is available with an open licence, has links to other people's information relating to the project as a whole (not the content of the project). However, the content is an image scan. While the scan is of good quality and allows for accurate searching and copying within the PDF download, it is not in machine readable structured data which makes the site fail all subsequent Linked Open Data principles.
