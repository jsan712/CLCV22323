## The Ancient Graffiti Project
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: Has backing from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Center for Hellenic Studies at Harvard University, The Andrew W. Mellong Foundation, Digital Humanities at Washington and Lee University, and more. Can export graffiti as EpiDoc, JSON, or CSV files. Has several specialized teams for each aspect of the project. Has recent scholars working on the project in 2023. No updates posted on the site, and their GitHub was last updated in December of 2022 by a bot. Human made contributions seem to last be updated in 2019.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Licenced under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Need permission to reproduce photographs and images. Do not charge to use license.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Some interactive map elements do not work. When searches yield no results the website only briefly flashes a message "No results. Try broadening your search." before replacing it wuth a message saying "2141 results found" meaning the site is now showing all graffiti. Search enegine is strong and intuitive.

* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Available on the web with an open licence. Available as machine-readable structured data in a non-proprietary format. Uses open standards from W3C to identify things. Links to outside data.

## Kenchreai Archaeological Archive
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: No updates on the GitHub page for this site since 2019. No way to download the data. Has 2023 copyright, backing from several large institutions and grants from large organizations, but no list of contributors, no updates on the site, no updates in the GitHub make this not sustainable or permanent.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Data and images are availbe for non-commerical, personal use at no charge.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: UI is unintuitive, just a simple search bar. When seraching for "pottery" clicking on an object and then selecting its "logical part of" link, there are so many connected objects that the site uses a lot of system resources while loading all of the objects. Not all objects have images or renders, just a pagescan of a field notebook. No visualizations, maps, or 3D scans/models of the objects. Confusing ontology. No real homepage.

* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: Available on the web with an open licence. Has some objects as machine-readable structured data in a non-proprietary format, but since others are only a pagescan, the project fails all subsequent criteria under the principles of Linked Open Data.
