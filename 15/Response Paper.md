## Based on your readings, expand shortly (less than 80 words) on the advantages of SPARQL over the other programming languages that we have examined this quarter.
The advantage of SPARQL over other programming languages is SPARQL endpoint which allows a webpage to be used as a database. SPARQL then leverages another advantage: the fact that it adopted English words as the means to initiate specific action to make the process of querying simpler. Additionally, SPARQL can query across several databases in one query and it queries graph databases, not relational databases, giving it the power to search in more complex databases.
