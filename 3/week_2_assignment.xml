I? Would I run? Would I yield? If I had fled before
I would return for this, to watch a new type of wedding.
Why hesitate, my soul? Follow your lucky strike.
This is a tiny fraction of your triumph.
You are still in love, mad heart, if this is enough:
to see Jason unmarried. Look for new punishment,
unprecedented, and prepare yourself:
let all morality be gone, and exile shame; 900
that vengeance is too light which clean hands can perform.
Spur on your anger, rouse your weary self,
from the depths of your heart draw up your former passions
with even greater violence. Whatever I did before,
name it dutiful love. Come now! I will reveal
how trivial and ordinary they were,
those crimes I did before. With them, my bitterness
was only practising: how could my childish hands
do something truly great? Could the rage of a girl do this?
Now, I am Medea.
