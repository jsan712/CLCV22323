# Digital Critiques
## Logeion
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Backed by UChicago, an institution that has a vested interest in the Classics, but has had no updates since November 2022. Can download favorited words as a txt file, but unable to download large amounts of data quickly-- has to be done word by word. No way to see their corpus or code.
    
* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Do not charge to use license and do not want to put any of their content behind pay walls. Can download data word by word and gives references for where they found their definitions and translations.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Can search for Latin and Greek words. Has features to search the corpus for the lemma. Has 5 different dictionaries that one can look at to find and reference their preferred translation, and a tab that shows examples of that lemma being used in the corpus. Tells you the frequency of the word and allows you to favorite the word and look back at your search history. No maps or visualizations. All links seem to work.

## OCHRE: An Online Cultural and Historical Research Environment
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Backed by UChicago and the UChicago library service, which both have a strong vested interest in the maintenance of this project. Charge a fee to use the software that usually paid for by grants, making this software not suitable for independent projects.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: There is a fee to use the software, but can use a limited version of the software for free to see how it works. Need special creditials to access a specific project.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: All links work on the physical website. Physical website and OCHRE platform have intuitive UI. For the actual software, all kinds of research are supported, including but not limited to: GIS maps, 3D models, images, and OWL ontologies.
