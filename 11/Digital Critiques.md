## Pompeii: 3D-explorer
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: There are current jobs open, a grant to teach 10 individuals about 3D modeling, a medium sized staff list, model available on sketchfab. All of these factors show the strength and breadth of the company and leads me to beleive it will not be shut down any time soon.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Despite having to really search for the downloadable options of their work, all of their scans are available for download from the Open Heritage 3D Data site and they do not charge for their license. They also show the process behind their documentation.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: All links and visualizations work on the site. The site UI is intuitive and well organized.

* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Available on the web with an open licence. Available as machine-readable structured data in a non-proprietary format. Uses open standards from W3C to identify things. Links to outside data.

## Searchable Greek Inscriptions (PHI)
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: Site and project are being maintained by a small team of epigraphers which are stated to have either retired or close to retiring. The project is in a transition period and has a last update from July 12, 2023, but transition periods are the easiest time for a project to shut down. No way to download the texts.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: No charge to use the license, but no way to download the data or contribute to the project.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: All of the links work, but no visualizations or maps. UI is very outdated and unintuitive.

* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Available on the web with an open licence. Available as machine-readable structured data in a non-proprietary format. Uses open standards from W3C to identify things. No links to outside data.
