# Digital Critiques
## Ancient Inscriptions from Israel / Palestine
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Backed by Brown University, but has a small team overseeing the project with no individual collaboration. Recent and frequent updates suggest site and project are being actively maintained. However, the small team and backing of only Brown University, while a large, wealthy institution that is invested in the Classical and Ancient Near Eastern world, means that should the current team quit working on the project, or if Brown pulls its funding, then the whole project ends. The lack of an ability to easily download the data from the site also hinders the project's ability to be permanent and sustainable.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Work licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License for which they do not charge. They give proper citations for all scholarly work and images used. No way to download the transcriptions or translations, but gives a citation of the source for the translation and/or transcription. Can find code and data for the project with the GitHub links at the bottom of the page.

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: The Guide to Seraching is not easy to find. However, if you know what you are looking for or you have read the Guide to Searching, then the serach functionality is great and advanced allowing for searches in English, Latin, Greek (using Greek polytonic characters without breathings or accents), Aramaic, and Hebrew. Can filter searches based on location, dates, inscription type, physical type, language, religion, and material. The interactive maps are a wonderful feature. All links and maps work.
    
* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Available on the web with an open licence. Available as machine-readable structured data in a non-proprietary format. Uses open standards from W3C to identify things. Links to outside data.

## The Oxyrhynchus Papyri
* Permanence and sustainability
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: Backed by Oxford University (an large, wealthy institution with deep roots in the ancient world), the Egypt Exploration Society, UK Research and Innovation, the British Academy, and UCL. A small team with no way for individuals to contribute to the project. Can download images of the texts, but must ask for permission to reproduce. Lack of individual contribution, updates, and ease of reproducability drop the grade down.

* Openness or restriction of their data
  * Grade: A
  * Reasoning: Do not charge a license fee. Can download images of the texts, but must ask permission to reproduce them. 

* Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data
  * Grade: B
  * Reasoning: No maps or visualizations. All of the links work. Images are high quality, but there is not a powerful enough digital zoom capability to get close to the text on the papyri. UI is not the most intuitive and serach function is hard to use unless you know what you are looking for.

* Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data)
  * Grade: C
  * Reasoning: Available on the web with an open licence and has links to outside data. Much of the site is available as machine-readable structured data, but because the actual texts are not, the project fails all subsequent criteria under the principles of Linked Open Data.
