## Weekly Response paper -- Based on your readings, expand shortly (less than 80-100 words) how has the integration of augmented reality in archaeology readings impacted our understanding of historical sites and museums.
The integration of augmented reality in archaeology impacts our understanding of historical sites and museums by further immersing the user in the object and its history. Often when viewing a cultural heritage site or object, the viewer is restricted by not being able to see the full monument potentially because it no longer exists, because it is in poor condition, or because it is behind glass. However, with augmented reality, the viewer can now see, in real-time, what the monument looked like in its prime and gives more clarification on how it was used.
